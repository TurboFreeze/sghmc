# Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

See https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4102.

To use, download the `hmc.py` file and use the following imports:

```
from hmc import hmc 	# standard HMC
from hmc import nsghmc 	# naive SGHMC
from hmc import sghmc 	# proper SGHMC
```

See the [documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TurboFreeze/sghmc/blob/master/hmc.html) for how to use these functions.
